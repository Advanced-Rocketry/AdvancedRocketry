> If it's an issue involving lag, please submit a VisualVM sampler snapshot.  Mods like lag goggles cannot provide all of the information needed to debug lag in any useful capacity.
> For more information on how to create a snapshot, please see "How to Run CPU Sampling" [here](http://greyfocus.com/2016/05/visualvm-sampling/).  Then export the snapshot as an .nps.  You may have to zip it since github is weird, then please upload it here.
