# AdvancedRocketry
Advanced Rocketry is a mod about space, exploration, and resources

<b>Advanced Rocketry does not support anything other than Forge at this point - be it Fabric (for 1.13+) or Sponge or similar for 1.12</b> 

<b>Please be aware Sponge compatibility issues may never be fixed.</b>

Current Features:



 - Rockets that can travel between planets & moons
   - Rockets can be configured to use or not use fuel (use fuel by default)
   - Can be built from almost any block
   - Can be upgraded with different propulsion options

   - Generated randomly from planet temperature & atmosphere
   - Mix of gas giants and rocky planets
 - Advanced XML options for custom planet creation
   - Features all Advanced Rocketry options
   - Allows mapping other mods dimensions to Advanced Rocketry planets
 - Black holes that you can use for power
 - Space stations
   - Can orbit any planet or moon
   - Can choose they amount of light the station gets contstantly by rotation
 - Warp ships, capable of going outside planet/moon and sun/planet systems
   - Planet Selection Guidance
   - Research system that allows for undiscovered planets
     - Requires data and artifact to be able to find planets

     - Can collect three types of data
     - Data is used for planetary discovery & asteroid mining
   - Oribtal solar power satellites
     - Used with the microwave reciever multiblock for power
   - Ore Scanning Satellite
 - Asteroid mining
   - Automated Harvesting
   - Research System
      - Random asteroid parameters ( size, composition, location (polar coords)
      - Research can be done to determine properties
   - Manual Harvesting
      - Player can select as a destination
      - temporary dim in created, destroyed when last player leaves
 - Gas Giant gas/fluid mining
 - Railguns to transfer goods between planets and stations
 - Support GTEU, EU, FE, Tesla, and RF as power supplies




Future Features:

 - Other engine types for space ships(NTR/ion)
 - Terraforming
 - Orbital factories
 - Rovers (maybe? planetary exploration?)
 - Docking (maybe..)
 - Planetary Mapping System (feasible?)
 - More Satellites
   - Weather Control Satellite
   - Mapping satellite (feasible?)
 - Clean Rooms
 - Research Tree (possible use for planetary data, hire villagers as scientists for you lab!)
 - Remove RF dependance
 - Stations can be positioned over certain locations on planets
 - Colony management system (seed testificates throughout the universe?)
 - Telescopes - 
   - Water Detectors (increases info on %dry) ~ space only
   - Chemical Detectors (increases chance of finding planets rich in certain ores) ~ space only
   - Atmospheric Detectors (increases info on pressure; when combined with chemical can detect if planet has harvestable/hazardous gasses) ~ ground and space 
   - Temperature Detector (increases info on planetary temperature) ~ space only
   - Star Scanner (increases the likelihood of finding planets orbiting a star; higher level allows for smaller planets) ~ ground and Space
   - Radio interferometry (lets you discover black holes and get any data quickly  ~ ground only
 - Hardmode
   - Must protect space stations from meteors
   - Rockets require life support
   - Space ships require stasis chamber and must be provided with food (unless warp)  -  tranz9999
   - Heat system for machines and plasma engine
