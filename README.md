# AdvancedRocketry
Advanced Rocketry is a mod about space, exploration, and resources

Discord link: https://discord.gg/BbBUmbX

Current Features:



 - Rockets can be built from almost any block
 - Space stations orbiting any planet/moon
 - Warp ships to take players between said planets
 - Planet Selection Guidance
 - Basic machinery (to be redone at future date)
 - Generates a fixed number of planets in a single solar system
 - Fuel Mechanics
 - Gas system (O2)
 - Satellites
 - Data collection of planets (not currently fully featured)
 - Support for IC2 EU and RF
 - Planets can be generated from XML
 - Gravity generators for space stations
 - Stations with day/night cycles
 - More Satellites
   - Mining Satellite (ish, is spacestation bound)
   - Energy Collection Satellite
   - Ore Scanning Satellite
 - Collection of materials from asteroids
 - Asteroids
   - Automated Harvesting
   - Research System
      - Random asteroid parameters ( size, composition, location (polar coords)
      - Research can be done to determine properties
   - Manual Harvesting
      - Player can select as a destination
      - temporary dim in created, destroyed when last player leaves
 - Collection of materials from gas giants
 - Railguns to transfer goods between planets and stations
 - Config for mapping dims added by other mods to planets
 - Gravity generators for local areas on planets
 - Black holes that you can use for power



Future Features:

 - Other engine types for space ships(ion/plasma)
 - Terraforming
 - Orbital factories
 - Rovers (maybe? planetary exploration?)
 - Docking (maybe..)
 - Planetary Mapping System (feasible?)
 - More Satellites
   - Weather Control Satellite
   - Mapping satellite (feasible?)
 - Clean Rooms
 - Research Tree (possible use for planetary data, hire villagers as scientists for you lab!)
 - Supports for more power systems
 - Remove RF dependance
 - Planets actually moving in their orbits
 - Stations can be positioned over certain locations on planets
 - Colony management system (seed testificates throughout the universe?)
 - Telescopes - 
   - Water Detectors (increases info on %dry) ~ space only
   - Chemical Detectors (increases chance of finding planets rich in certain ores) ~ space only
   - Atmospheric Detectors (increases info on pressure; when combined with chemical can detect if planet has harvestable/hazardous gasses) ~ ground and space 
   - Temperature Detector (increases info on planetary temperature) ~ space only
   - Star Scanner (increases the likelihood of finding planets orbiting a star; higher level allows for smaller planets) ~ ground and Space
   - Radio interferometry (lets you discover black holes and get any data quickly  ~ ground only
 - Hardmode
   - Must protect space stations from meteors
   - Rockets require life support
   - Space ships require stasis chamber and must be provided with food (unless warp)  -  tranz9999
   - Heat system for machines and plasma engine
